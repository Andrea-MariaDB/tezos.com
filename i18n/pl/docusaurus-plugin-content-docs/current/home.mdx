### Secure, Institutional Grade Smart Contracts

Tezos is designed to provide the safety and code correctness required for assets and other high value use cases. Its native smart contract language, Michelson, facilitates formal verification, a methodology commonly used in mission-critical environments such as the aerospace, nuclear, and semiconductor industries.

### Upgradable to the State of the Art

Tezos' modular architecture and formal upgrade mechanism allow the network to propose and adopt new technological innovations smoothly as they emerge. These aspects, combined with Tezos' on-chain invoicing mechanism, enable the protocol to remain the state-of-the-art long into the future -- without sacrificing community consensus.

### Open Participation and Incentive Alignment

In Tezos, all stakeholders may participate in network upgrades by evaluating, proposing, or approving amendments. Unlike in Proof-of-Work and other Proof-of-Stake networks, all stakeholders can help to secure the network (via baking or delegating), and avoid being diluted by inflation.
